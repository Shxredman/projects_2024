      <h1>What is Python?</h1>
      <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>

    <p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</p>
    
  <h1>Comparing Python to Other Languages</h1>
  <p>Python is often compared to other interpreted languages such as Java, JavaScript, Perl, Tcl, or Smalltalk. Comparisons to C++, Common Lisp and Scheme can also be enlightening. In this section I will briefly compare Python to each of these languages. These comparisons concentrate on language issues only. In practice, the choice of a programming language is often dictated by other real-world constraints such as cost, availability, training, and prior investment, or even emotional attachment. Since these aspects are highly variable, it seems a waste of time to consider them much for this comparison.</p>

<h2>Java</h2>
<p>Python programs are generally expected to run slower than Java programs, but they also take much less time to develop. Python programs are typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java programs. This difference can be attributed to Python's built-in high-level data types and its dynamic typing. For example, a Python programmer wastes no time declaring the types of arguments or variables, and Python's powerful polymorphic list and dictionary types, for which rich syntactic support is built straight into the language, find a use in almost every Python program. Because of the run-time typing, Python's run time must work harder than Java's. For example, when evaluating the expression a+b, it must first inspect the objects a and b to find out their type, which is not known at compile time. It then invokes the appropriate addition operation, which may be an overloaded user-defined method. Java, on the other hand, can perform an efficient integer or floating point addition, but requires variable declarations for a and b, and does not allow overloading of the + operator for instances of user-defined classes.</p>

<p>For these reasons, Python is much better suited as a "glue" language, while Java is better characterized as a low-level implementation language. In fact, the two together make an excellent combination. Components can be developed in Java and combined to form applications in Python; Python can also be used to prototype components until their design can be "hardened" in a Java implementation. To support this type of development, a Python implementation written in Java is under development, which allows calling Python code from Java and vice versa. In this implementation, Python source code is translated to Java bytecode (with help from a run-time library to support Python's dynamic semantics).</p>

      <h1>Installation</h1>
      <p>Installing Python is generally easy, and nowadays many Linux and UNIX distributions include a recent Python. Even some Windows computers (notably those from HP) now come with Python already installed. If you do need to install Python and aren't confident about the task you can find a few notes on the BeginnersGuide/Download wiki page, but installation is unremarkable on most platforms.<p>

   <h1>Windows: How to Install Python From the Microsoft Store</h1>
   <p>If you’re new to Python and focused primarily on learning the language rather than building professional software, then you can install Python from the Microsoft Store. The package there offers the shortest and easiest path to getting started with minimal hassle.

The Python installer in the Microsoft Store has some limitations. The official Python documentation has this to say about the Microsoft Store package:</p>
  <p>The key takeaway is that the Python package on the Microsoft Store is “intended mainly for interactive use.” It’s designed for students and people learning Python for the first time.</p>
  <p>In addition to targeting beginning Pythonistas, the package on the Microsoft Store has limitations that make it ill-suited for a professional development environment. In particular, it doesn’t have full write access to shared locations such as TEMP or the registry.</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Open the Python App Page on the Microsoft Store</h2>
  <p>Open the Microsoft Store app on your Windows machine and search for Python. You’ll likely see multiple versions that you can choose to install. Select the latest version of Python available in the store to open the installation page.</p>
  <div>
    <p>Note: Make sure that the Python application you’ve selected is by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), which is the organization behind Python’s development.</p>
<p>The official Python app on the Microsoft Store is free, so if the Python app costs you money, then it’s the wrong application.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Step 2: Install the Python App</h2>
  <p>After you’ve selected the version to be installed, follow these steps to complete the installation:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click the Get button.</li>
    <li>Wait for the app to download and install.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Once the installation is complete, open Windows PowerShell and run the python --version command to confirm that Python is installed on your machine.</p>
  <p>Along with the Python interpreter, you can access a few other tools, including pip and IDLE!</p>
